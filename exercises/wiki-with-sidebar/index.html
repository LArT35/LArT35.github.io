            <h4>Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton with the
             birth name of Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth
             in a small spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed in a
             natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside
             near the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. He was found
             and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named
             him Clark Kent. Clark began developing various superhuman
             abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin.
             His adoptive parents advised him to use his powers for
             the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as
             a vigilante. To protect his personal life, he changes 
             into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman"
             when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional 
             American city of Metropolis, where he works as a 
             journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting
             characters include his love interest and fellow 
             journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy 
             Olsen, and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies
             include Brainiac, General Zod, and archenemy Lex Luthor.

                Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending 
                Glenville High School in Cleveland and bonded over their 
                admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and
                Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur
                science fiction stories, which he self-published as a 
                magazine called Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future
                Civilization. His friend Shuster often provided illustrations
                for his work.[3] In January 1933, Siegel published a short 
                story in his magazine titled "The Reign of the Superman".
                The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is
                tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental
                drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, 
                mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously
                for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, 
                leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided 
                illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.[4]
